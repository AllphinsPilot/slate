# Introduction

https://app.allphins.com/api/v1/
```

The Allphins API is organized around REST. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

This API reference provides information on available endpoints and how to interact with it.
